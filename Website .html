	<h1> Sweating </h1>
		<p> It’s a nuisance, but surely you know that. Moisture on the skin seeps into clothing, making one’s sweat obvious, which is generally considered unattractive, and creates a perfect medium for bacterial growth and the odor that ensues. Wet skin is softer and more vulnerable to abrasion (blisters) or other forms of physical damage.Once the sweat evaporates, salt is left behind and can become quite uncomfortable when the skin finally dries. Salt from sweat will leave salt line stains on gloves, boots and other clothing.</p>
